## Hi there, I am Shrushrita Sharma !!! 👋

As your go-to Quality Assurance Engineer with a passion for finding the tiniest bugs (🐛) and squeezing them out of existence(🚫🐞), I thrive on the critical journey of ensuring quality in every digital nook and cranny. Trained in Agile environment, my career has been a thrilling rollercoaster ride of innovation and problem-solving, and I'm here to make sure the software application is smoother than butter on a hot pancake!

With Biomedical Engineering(🩺🤓) as my education, I bring forth extra layer of precision and analytical eye to my tasks. I have worked with Medical Imaging Software Application for making clinical decisions and ensuring verification and validation against FDA, and ISO guidelines. In the world of software engineering, even a small glitch can have big impact and in biomedicine, it can be a matter of life and death(💉)! Just like in biomedicine, where every molecule counts, I understand that every line of code matters. It's about ensuring that the systems we build are as reliable as a heartbeat💓. So, whether I'm troubleshooting a medical device or a software application, my goal remains the same: PERFECTION.

🤝Beyond the realm of technology, you'll find me volunteering my time with seniors (👴👵), learning from their life experiences and stories. I'm also passionate about career mentoring(💬), guiding them to navigate the exciting and ever-changing landscape of Canadian workforce(🌍).
